# Rust Book Trial

study of rust.

### Personal Notes

- snack_case for values and functions, CamelCase for Types and Classes.
- return a expression without `;` in the end.
- clone for number, `bool`, `char` while move for `String` as default assign value behavior.
    - depends on implementing `Copy` or not.
